# Progress Steps

# Having Fun

Had fun with this project by adding the progress steps to display a new evolution of Charmander, concluding at Charzard.

# Practical

A more practical implementation would be applying this to a sign up form. Each step would be requesting new information, such as name or email, with the final step being a review of the user input.
