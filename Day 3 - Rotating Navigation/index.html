            <h1>The Story Never Told</h1>
            <small>Chris Santiago</small>
            <h3>Back Story</h3>
            <p>However, I began experiencing issues much earlier than I anticipated. It would fail to boot constantly.  It would then attempt to go into recovery mode and safe boot. When that failed, it would attempt to reboot before never turning back on. I grew increasingly frustrated. After discussing what I was experiencing with a Microsoft service member, we concluded that I had received a faulty motherboard. My hours of blog scraping confirmed this. Not wanting to put additional money into an already $1,400 laptop I began to look around for alternatives. </p>

            <h3>Cue the World of PC Building</h3>
            <p>Ignorantly, I did not realize how big of a space custom pc building is. I consumed HOURS of content on YouTube. Then HOURS annoying my wife with contradictory ideas of what parts I should get. I had the novel idea of waiting until Black Friday to save money on parts, potentially allowing me to upgrade a couple. I spent the next couple of weeks on pcpartpicker.com perfecting my build. To my surprise (ignorantly), parts were flying out of stock. Safe to say, I was rarely away from a device or my wallet for more than 15 minutes. Over the weekend, I was slowly able to gather my components. I saved a little money here and there but well short of my expectations. However, one component eluded me. The precious GPU. I only planned on doing light gaming, so this was not an immediate concern of mine. Until it was. EVERYTHING was sold out, and anything available was hundreds of dollars more than I anticipated. I was devastated. COVID had put such a strain on the market, that it couldn't keep up. Savy web scrapers were buying all the GPUs up and selling them to the highest bidder. With all hope lost, I turned to my faithful YouTubers and bloggers for advice. It was anticipated that the market could recover in early 2021. So My hunt for a PC was staled. </p>
            <h3>Put a Couple of Seconds  Back On The Clock</h3>
            <p>Not being able to let go, I would occasionally check if any of my top choices back in stock. Only to see nothing has changed. But it couldn't hurt to look, right? Sure enough! I snagged a 1660 super on NewEgg at the initial launch price. Our AI overloads must have been watching over me. And here she is!</p>
